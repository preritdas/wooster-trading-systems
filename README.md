On top of the pip requirements, must have TA-Lib core (kind of a pain) and pretty soon firebase CLI for serving and deploying the interactive result plots.


```bash
wooster process 1 --no-results --launch  # open interactive plot in browser
wooster process 1 --no-optimize
wooster process 1 --optimizer "Sharpe Ratio"  
```
